### File Format

Drawings are saved as JSON files with the structure:
```json
{
  "type": "excalidraw",
  "version": 2,
  "elements": [...],
  "appState": {...},
  "files": {
    "fileId": {
      "dataURL": "data:image/png;base64,..."
    }
  }
}
```

### Browser Support

- Modern browsers with ES6 module support
- Chrome 61+, Firefox 60+, Safari 11+, Edge 16+

## Development

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository
2. Serve the files over HTTPS (required for Box OAuth):
   ```bash
   npx http-server -S -p 8080
   ```
3. Update Box OAuth redirect URI to `https://localhost:8080`

### File Structure

```
excalidraw-box/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html          # Main application file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md          # This file
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore         # Git ignore rules
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No authorization code" error**
- Ensure you're launching from Box using "Open With"
- Check that OAuth redirect URI matches exactly

**Images not saving/loading**
- Verify file permissions in Box
- Check browser console for serialization errors

**Authentication failures**
- Confirm Client ID and Secret are correct
- Ensure app is authorized in Box Admin Console

### Debug Mode

Add `?debug=true` to the URL to enable verbose console logging:
```
https://yourdomain.github.io/excalidraw-box/?debug=true&fileId=123&authCode=abc
```
